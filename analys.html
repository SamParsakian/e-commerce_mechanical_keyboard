            <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
            <p>
               The purpose of the task was to build a responsive webpage that
               showcases products, is user-friendly, and visually appealing. I
               used HTML and CSS to structure and style the page, focusing on
               implementing good web development practices such as layout,
               typography, and optimization.(<strong>
                  Note; Although comments in HTML and CSS serve a completely
                  different purpose, I decided to include more detailed
                  explanations within the HTML and CSS files as comments to
                  clarify the reasons behind using these queries. </strong
               >)
            </p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <h1>2. Programming Choices</h1>
            <p>
               I built the page using HTML5 for the structure and CSS for the
               styling. To make sure the design looks consistent across
               different browsers, I started with Normalize.css to reset the
               default styles.
            </p>

            <h3>2.1 HTML5</h3>
            <p>
               Following the example project, I used HTML5 to add several
               features: a header with a logo, a navigation menu, and a search
               bar for quick access to key sections. The main section of the
               page includes a banner that highlights the store's purpose,
               followed by a product gallery showing images, descriptions, and
               prices for easy comparison. There’s also a subscription section
               to encourage visitors to sign up for the newsletter.
            </p>
            <p>
               The footer is divided into columns that provide detailed
               information about the brand, navigation links, contact details,
               and social media icons. This layout creates a smooth flow from
               introduction to interaction, making it simple for visitors to
               browse the page and connect with the content.
            </p>
         </section>

         <h3>2.2 CSS Reset</h3>
         <p>
            I used Normalize.min.css to make sure the webpage looks consistent
            across different browsers. It’s a common and recommended practice
            for achieving uniform rendering. As MDN Web Docs explains, "If you
            feel you truly need to use a reset, consider using Normalize.css by
            Nicolas Gallagher, which aims to make things more consistent across
            browsers" (MDN Web Docs, 2025).
         </p>
         <p>
            To keep things consistent and easy to maintain, I used an external
            style.css file with the HTML structure. This stylesheet handles the
            visual design of the page, like typography, layout, and
            responsiveness, while keeping content and design separate. Key parts
            of the page, such as the header, product gallery, and footer, were
            styled to create a unified and professional look.
         </p>

         <h3>2.3 Box Model</h3>
         <p>
            "box-sizing: border-box;" was used, by implementing margins,
            padding, and borders are included in the total size of elements.
            This was especially important for matching the example project, like
            aligning lists in the footer directly under the relevant headings by
            adjusting padding and margins.Following is an image of chrome
            browser's box Model, taking from ul elements in footer. And again
            same story here and there for achieving same desiered result for
            alignments.
         </p>
         <img src="/images/analys1.jpg" alt="" />

         <h3>2.4 Units</h3>
         <p>
            To make the design responsive, I used pixels (px) for fixed sizes
            like the logo, while percentages or viewport width units (vw) were
            used for flexible elements. For example, the banner image was set to
            auto for its width and 100% for its height, allowing it to adjust
            smoothly to different screen sizes. I also added CSS breakpoints to
            change the layout based on specific viewport widths for better
            adaptability.
         </p>

         <ul>
            <li>Desktop: min-width: 1200px</li>
            <li>Tablet: min-width: 768px and max-width: 1199px</li>
            <li>
               Large phones (Phablet): min-width: 576px and max-width: 767px
            </li>
            <li>Small phones: max-width: 575px</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            These breakpoints help optimize the viewing experience across a wide
            range of devices (Hoverify, 2024).
         </p>

         <section>
            <h1>3. Layout</h1>
            <p>
               In my CSS file, I used various layout techniques to make the
               webpage responsive and well-organized. For instance, I used the
               @font-face rule to include custom fonts like "Selawik," which
               adds typographic consistency to the page. In the header, I
               applied Flexbox with "display: flex;" to align the logo,
               navigation menu, and search bar in a horizontal layout, ensuring
               flexibility and adaptability. For the .products class, I used CSS
               Grid Layout with "display: grid;" and "grid-template-columns:
               repeat(4, 1fr);" to create a product gallery. The number of
               columns adjusts automatically based on the screen size for the
               best display across devices.
            </p>

            <h3>3.1 Navigation</h3>
            <p>
               I removed the default list styles from the navigation links by
               setting "list-style-type: none;" and cleared default margins and
               padding with "margin: 0;" and "padding: 0;". To arrange the
               navigation links in a horizontal line, I applied "display: flex;"
               to the "ul" element, making it easy to align and space the items.
               Each "a" tag in the navigation was styled with "display: block;",
               "padding: 10px 15px;", "text-decoration: none;", "border: 2px
               solid #000;", "border-radius: 5px;", "color: #000;", and
               "background-color: #f9f9f9;" to give it a button-like appearance.
               For interactivity, I added a hover effect using "nav a:hover {
               background-color: #000; color: #fff; }", which changes the
               background and text colors when the user hovers over the links.
            </p>
         </section>

         <h3>3.2 Footer</h3>
         <p>
            I designed the footer using CSS Grid Layout by setting "display:
            grid;" and "grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);", which creates
            four equal columns for neatly distributing the content. To make it
            responsive, I used media queries to reduce the number of columns on
            smaller screens, ensuring the footer remains user-friendly across
            different devices.This method aligns with established best practices
            for responsive footer design, as discussed in "Building a Responsive
            Footer: A Guide to HTML and CSS Techniques" (Musing, 2025).
         </p>

         <h3>3.3 CSS Grid</h3>
         <p>
            I used CSS Grid Layout to design a responsive layout. In the
            .products section, I set up a grid container with "display: grid;"
            and defined the columns using "grid-template-columns: repeat(4,
            1fr);", creating four evenly spaced columns. To make the layout
            adaptable for different screen sizes, I added media queries that
            adjust the number of columns based on the viewport width.
         </p>

         <h3>3.4 Flexbox</h3>
         <p>
            I used the Flexbox layout to create a responsive and flexible
            structure. In the header section, I applied "display: flex;" to set
            up a flex container, which allowed the child elements—like the logo,
            navigation menu, and search bar—to align horizontally.These Flexbox
            properties contribute to a clean and adaptable layout, enhancing
            responsiveness across different screen sizes (Coyier, 2024).
         </p>

         <h3>3.5 Spacing</h3>
         <p>
            I used margin and padding to ensure readable spacing. For instance,
            product cards were given "padding: 10px;" to create space around
            their content and "gap: 20px;" to keep the cards nicely separated.
         </p>

         <h3>3.6 Typography</h3>
         <p>
            II used custom fonts with "@font-face" and set 16px as the base font
            size. For better readability, I applied "font-weight: 800;" to
            headings and "line-height: 1.6;" to paragraphs.
         </p>

         <section>
            <h1>4. Breakpoints</h1>
            <p>
               I used media queries to set breakpoints at 1200px, 768px, and
               575px. On smaller screens, the number of product columns reduces
               to two and eventually one, and the header elements stack
               vertically for better usability.
            </p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <h1>5. Image Optimization</h1>
            <p>
               I optimized the images by applying "max-width: 100%;" and
               "height: auto;" to make sure they adjust properly to the
               available space without exceeding their container's width. This
               approach was used for elements such as product images and the
               banner image, enabling them to scale seamlessly and maintain
               their aspect ratio across various screen sizes, ensuring a
               consistent and responsive layout.
            </p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <h1>6. Printing</h1>
            <p>
               I customized print settings to create a clean and readable
               version of the webpage, focusing on key information like product
               lists while hiding non-essential elements such as headers,
               banners, and search fields. For example, I used a two-column
               layout to make product details clear and easy to read on standard
               A4 paper. However, the footer may still appear in the printed PDF
               due to the browser's default print settings.
            </p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <h1>7. Compatibility</h1>
            <p>
               I used modern HTML5 and CSS features, such as Grid and Flexbox,
               which are compatible with most modern browsers. For example, the
               page was tested thoroughly in Chrome and Firefox to confirm
               proper functionality and responsiveness. While some older
               browsers might not fully support these advanced properties, I
               took extra steps to check their compatibility using tools like
               [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/). This ensured that the webpage
               would perform well for the majority of users while leveraging the
               latest web development techniques. Green boxes in following
               images show the availibility of Flexible box in differnt
               browser.(Can I Use, 2024).

         <section>
            <h1>8. Bugs and Issues</h1>
            <p>
               One challenge I faced was that some elements did not scale
               properly on smaller screens. To fix this, I adjusted media
               queries and added "overflow: hidden;" to the banner, preventing
               layout issues and ensuring a smoother display. Another issue I
               identified using [W3C
               Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file) was the improper
               use of the "articl>" tag for separating products. The validator
               highlighted that a "header" was required for each "article"
               element. To resolve this, I replaced "articl>" with "div" tags,
               which corrected the problem and improved the semantic accuracy of
               the HTML structure.
            </p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <h1>9. Summary</h1>
            <p>
               I approached this task with a clear goal of building a responsive
               and visually appealing website, which allowed me to practice and
               refine key web development skills. The most challenging part was
               trying to replicate the exact results from the example project,
               particularly rearranging the footer columns for different screen
               sizes. Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for the layout was tricky at
               first, especially making sure the design adapted well to various
               screen widths. However, structuring the page with HTML5 turned
               out to be easier than I anticipated, as its elements are
               intuitive and straightforward. Optimizing images and ensuring
               browser compatibility took some extra effort, but it was a
               valuable learning experience. Overall, this project not only
               helped me improve my technical skills but also boosted my
               confidence in web development.
